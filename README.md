C - Sorting algorithms

A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending.
What I learned in this project

    At least four different sorting algorithms
    What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
    How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
    What is a stable sorting algorithm
